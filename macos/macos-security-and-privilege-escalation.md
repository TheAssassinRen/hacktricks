# MacOS Security & Privilege Escalation

First of all, please note that **most of the tricks about privilege escalation affecting Linux/Unix will affect also MacOS** machines. So see:

{% page-ref page="../linux-unix/privilege-escalation/" %}

## Security Restrictions

### Gatekeeper

_Gatekeeper_ is designed to ensure that, by default, **only trusted software runs on a user’s Mac**. Gatekeeper is used when a user **downloads** and **opens** an app, a plug-in or an installer package from outside the App Store. Gatekeeper verifies that the **software is from an identified developer**, is notarised by Apple to be **free of known malicious content**, and **hasn’t been altered**. Gatekeeper also **requests user approval** before opening downloaded software for the first time to make sure the user hasn’t been tricked into running executable code they believed to simply be a data file.

Gatekeeper builds upon **File Quarantine.**  
Upon download of an application, a particular **extended file attribute** \("quarantine flag"\) can be **added** to the **downloaded** **file**. This attribute **is added by the application that downloads the file**, such as a **web** **browser** or email client, but is not usually added by others like common BitTorrent client software.  
When a user executes a "quarentined" file, **Gatekeeper** is the one that **performs the mentioned actions** to allow the execution of the file.

It's possible to **check it's status and enable/disable** \(root required\) with:

```bash
spctl --status
assessments enabled

spctl --enable
spctl --disable
#You can also allow nee identifies to execute code using the binary "spctl"
```

You can also **find if a file has the quarantine extended attribute** with:

```bash
xattr portada.png
com.apple.macl
com.apple.quarantine
```

Check the **value** of the **extended** **attributes** with:

```bash
xattr -l portada.png
com.apple.macl:
00000000  03 00 53 DA 55 1B AE 4C 4E 88 9D CA B7 5C 50 F3  |..S.U..LN.....P.|
00000010  16 94 03 00 27 63 64 97 98 FB 4F 02 84 F3 D0 DB  |....'cd...O.....|
00000020  89 53 C3 FC 03 00 27 63 64 97 98 FB 4F 02 84 F3  |.S....'cd...O...|
00000030  D0 DB 89 53 C3 FC 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |...S............|
00000040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                          |........|
00000048
com.apple.quarantine: 0081;607842eb;Brave;F643CD5F-6071-46AB-83AB-390BA944DEC5
```

And **remove** that attribute with:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine portada.png
#You can also remove this attribute from every file with
find . -iname '*' -print0 | xargs -0 xattr -d com.apple.quarantine
```

And find all the quarantined files with:

```bash
find / -exec ls -ld {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -E "[x\-]@ " | awk '{printf $9; printf "\n"}' | xargs -I {} xattr -lv {} | grep "com.apple.quarantine"
```

## Common users

* **Daemon**: User reserved for system daemons
* **Guest**: Account for guests with very strict permissions
* **Nobody**: Processes are executed with this user when minimal permissions are required
* **Root**

## **File ACLs**

When the file contains ACLs you will **find a "+" when listing the permissions like in**:

```bash
ls -ld Movies
drwx------+   7 username  staff     224 15 Apr 19:42 Movies
```

You can **read the ACLs** of the file with:

```bash
ls -lde Movies
drwx------+ 7 username  staff  224 15 Apr 19:42 Movies
 0: group:everyone deny delete
```

You can find **all the files with ACLs** with \(this is veeery slow\):

```bash
ls -RAle / 2>/dev/null | grep -E -B1 "\d: "
```

## Resource Forks or MacOS ADS

This is a way to obtain **Alternate Data Streams in MacOS** machines. You can save content inside an extended attribute called **com.apple.ResourceFork** inside a file by saving it in **file/..namedfork/rsrc**.

```bash
echo "Hello" > a.txt
echo "Hello Mac ADS" > a.txt/..namedfork/rsrc

xattr -l a.txt #Read extended attributes
com.apple.ResourceFork: Hello Mac ADS

ls -l a.txt #The file length is still q
-rw-r--r--@ 1 username  wheel  6 17 Jul 01:15 a.txt
```

You can **find all the files containing this extended attribute** with:

```bash
find / -type f -exec ls -ld {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -E "[x\-]@ " | awk '{printf $9; printf "\n"}' | xargs -I {} xattr -lv {} | grep "com.apple.ResourceFork"
```

## OS X Specific Extensions

* **`.dmg`**: Apple Disk Image files are very frequent for installers.
* **`.kext`**: It must follow a specific structure and it's the OS X version of a driver.
* **`.plist`**: Also known as property list stores information in XML or binary format.
* **`.app`**: Apple applications that follows  directory structure.
* **`.dylib`**: Dynamic libraries \(like Windows DLL files\)
* **`.pkg`**: Are the same as xar \(eXtensible Archive format\). The installer command can be use to install the contents of these files.

## File hierarchy layout

* **/Applications**: The installed apps should be here. All the users will be able to access them.
* **/bin**: Command line binaries
* **/cores**: If exists, it's used to store core dumps
* **/dev**: Everything is treated as a file so you may see hardware devices stored here.
* **/etc**: Configuration files
* **/Library**: A lot of subdirectories and files related to preferences, caches and logs can be found here. A Library folder exists in root and on each user's directory.
* **/private**: Undocumented but a lot of the mentioned folders are symbolic links to the private directory.
* **/sbin**: Essential system binaries \(related to administration\)
* **/System**: File fo making OS X run. You should find mostly only Apple specific files here \(not third party\).
* **/tmp**: Files are deleted after 3 days \(it's a soft link to /private/tmp\)
* **/Users**: Home directory for users.
* **/usr**: Config and system binaries
* **/var**: Log files
* **/Volumes**: The mounted drives will apear here.
* **/.vol**: Running `stat a.txt` you obtain something like `16777223 7545753 -rw-r--r-- 1 username wheel ...` where the first number is the id number of the volume where the file exists and the second one is the inode number. You can access the content of this file through /.vol/ with that information running  `cat /.vol/16777223/7545753`
